<h3>
The Smell Test&nbsp;</h3>
<b>Sniff the open container </b>to check if it has a noticeably sour aroma. &nbsp;This is not always foolproof for detecting marginally bad milk, but will generally protect you from milk that is well past salvation. &nbsp;After expiration, or if it has been left out of the refrigerator too long, milk begins to curdle. &nbsp;Curdling milk will start to smell more like cheese than milk and have chunks in it. &nbsp;You don't need to stick your nose in it to sniff it. &nbsp;If milk has gotten to the point where it begins to smell bad, you can smell it from several inches away. &nbsp;Some people find smelling milk in public offensive, like at the office, so be discrete if you're going to sniff other people's milk. &nbsp;Check the expiration date first or pass the open container of milk casually past your chin to see if there is a strong smell if you're in public view. <br />
<br />
<h3>
The Chunk Test&nbsp;</h3>
Pour a tiny bit of milk in the sink to see if there are any <b>visible chunks</b>. &nbsp;This is more definitive of a test than the smell test, but it is wasteful which may upset some people. &nbsp;Again, If you're doing this test at the office you should be discrete or try one of the other tests first to see if you have reason to assume the milk has gone bad..<br />
<br />
<h3>
The Coffee Test</h3>
Sometimes sour milk passes the smell test, so you end up pouring it in your coffee. &nbsp;If the milk has gone sour, <b>the milk will stay on the bottom of your cup</b> and the coffee will <b>stay dark in color</b>. &nbsp;Good milk generally changes the color of hot coffee as the cold milk heats up and rises to the top, making the coffee lighter in color. &nbsp;A regular milk and coffee drinker should be accustomed to the way milk swirls into the coffee making it light brown as you pour. &nbsp;Therefore, if you notice that the coffee does NOT get significantly lighter when you pour it in, the milk is denser than usual and is not rising to the top. &nbsp;This is a sign that it has started to turn sour. &nbsp;Check the milk using the chunk test or the sip test before drinking<br />
<br />
<h3>
The Sip Test&nbsp;</h3>
This is the test of last resort since you're actually experimenting on yourself. &nbsp;Any of the above tests should be performed first. &nbsp;Take a tiny bit of milk in a cup or spoon and take a sip. &nbsp;If it <b>tastes "tingly" on your&nbsp;tongue</b>, similar to the feeling of a carbonated drink like cola in your mouth, the milk has started to turn sour. &nbsp;At this point you may want to proceed to the chunk test, or just throw the milk out. &nbsp;If you're really in dire straights and it's not too bad, you may even just drink the milk. <br />

<h3>
My experience</h3>
Sniff test is the easiest and should be the first line of defense to ward against sour milk. &nbsp;On those occasions when i don't think about checking the milk for freshness before I pour it in my coffee,&nbsp;the coffee test is a great backup plan. &nbsp;Once I notice that the milk isn't rising to the top or changing color like it usually does, I know something is amiss. &nbsp;I saved my office from a bad carton of milk yesterday with this technique.
