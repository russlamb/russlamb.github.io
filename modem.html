    <h2>Fixing Time Warner Wireless Modem</h2>
<div>
So I got hooked up with Time warner cable roadrunner internet service, but I was having trouble hooking up my wireless router to the cable modem. &nbsp;Here are a few quick steps I took to resolve the issue.<br />

<br /></div>
<div>
When the technician arrived, he called time warner to give them the serial number on my modem and then had me connect the modem to my PC and test out the internet. &nbsp;I followed the on-screen prompts and was able to connect to the internet soon after. &nbsp;Once he left, I took the cable out of my PC and plugged it into my wireless router. &nbsp;When I connected wirelessly via the same PC, I couldn't connect to the internet. <br />
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
After much googling, the issue is due to the way the Time warner cable modem detects PCs. &nbsp;It restricts internet access to the MAC address of the last computer to connect to it and go through the on-screen registration. &nbsp;The wireless router needs to "clone" this address to get the cable modem to recognize it and connect to the internet. &nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
I found it misleading when I connected to my wireless router and it offered to clone my PC's MAC address by pushing a button. &nbsp;If you are connecting to the wireless router wirelessly but the cable modem is wired, the MAC addresses will be different. &nbsp;So, when I pushed the clone my PC's MAC address button, the wireless router cloned the wrong address. &nbsp;I had to connect my PC to the modem using a wired connection, find out what my MAC address is and manually type it in.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
When you run the command "ipconfig /all" from the command prompt, you'll see it as the "Physical Address" of your ethernet connection. &nbsp;Now just enter that value in your wireless router's configuration settings.</div>
