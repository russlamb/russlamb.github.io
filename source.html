<p class="note">Note: The above link takes you to the github repository page</p>
<p>This was a utility package created with Panda and Python to strip the header rows off Excel (.xls) files.</p>
<p>I used this as part of an Extract Transform Load project to automate file processing and load into a database.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/russlamb/python-filewatch">File Watcher</a></h3>
<p class="note">Note: The above link takes you to the github repository page</p>
<p>This is a long running process that watches a directory for any new files.  If it finds one, and it matches a set of patterns, it moves the file to a different directory.</P>
<p>I'm using this to monitor and organize my downloads.</p>
